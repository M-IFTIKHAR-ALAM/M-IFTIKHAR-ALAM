Hi, Iâ€™m @M-IFTIKHAR-ALAM Hi I was started my Carier in GENERAL INSURANCE and LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS and I got a lot of training about insurance from time to time 
and I received the GOLD MEDALEST in 1993 from the STATE LIFE INSURANCE CORPORATION OF PAKISTAN. I spent my time on insurance and faced maney chanllenges in my life, but I am still standing. 
And now I have the need and requiremets for Computer Programming and am spending my time learning computer programming languages, this my aim of life: to achieve this goal.
Due to current circumstances.Iâ€™m interested in Python,because this Language growing fast compared to others languages and Python is very intersting Programming Language.
